# Connect Unisat React dApp Boilerplate

## Overview

This boilerplate provides a foundational setup for developers looking to build decentralized applications (dApps) on the BRC20 token standard utilizing the Unisat Wallet. It's crafted with React and integrates essential functionalities to connect with the Unisat Wallet API, allowing for seamless interaction with BRC20 tokens.

## Features

- Pre-configured React environment for rapid dApp development on BRC20 tokens.
- Integrated connection with the Unisat Wallet API for fetching and displaying wallet inscriptions.
- Simplified state management for balances and transactions of BRC20 tokens.
- User-friendly interface components using Ant Design for displaying token information.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Larkhell/connect-unisat-react-dapp.git
cd connect-unisat-react-dapp
npm install
```

## Usage

Run the application in development mode with:

```bash
npm start
```

This command starts the development server and opens the dApp in your default web browser.

## Structure

The boilerplate includes the following key components:

- `App`: The main component that orchestrates the connection to the Unisat Wallet and data presentation.
- `fetchContentData`: A helper function for making HTTP requests to retrieve content data.
- `TickerBalance` and `Inscription`: Interfaces that define the data structure for the wallet's tickers and inscriptions.

## Building Your dApp

To start building your dApp, modify the existing components and add new ones as per your project's requirements. This boilerplate is designed to be flexible and easily extendable to accommodate various dApp functionalities.
